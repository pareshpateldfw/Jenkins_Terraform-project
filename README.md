Setup &amp; Build Jenkins using AWS/Terraform Platform 
Step-by-Step Guide to Launch Terraform Project
Prerequisites
1. Install Terraform: Ensure you have Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download it from the 
2. AWS CLI: Install and configure the AWS CLI with the necessary credentials. Follow the 
Step 1: Unzip the Project
Unzip the terraform_project.zip file to your desired location.
```bash
unzip terraform_project.zip -d terraform-project
cd terraform-project
```
Step 2: Initialize the Environment
Navigate to the environment directory you want to deploy (e.g., dev).
```bash
cd envs/dev
```
Initialize the Terraform workspace. This command initializes the backend and installs necessary plugins.
```bash
terraform init
```
Step 3: Review the Configuration
It's good practice to review the Terraform configuration before applying it.
```bash
terraform plan
```
This command will show you what changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure.
Step 4: Apply the Configuration
Apply the Terraform configuration to create the infrastructure. This command will create the resources defined in your Terraform files.
```bash
terraform apply
```
You will be prompted to confirm before applying the changes. Type `yes` and press Enter.
Step 5: Verify the Deployment
After the apply command completes, you can verify the deployment.
1. AWS Console: Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the relevant services (e.g., EC2) to see the resources created.
2. Terraform Outputs: If there are any output variables defined, Terraform will display them after the apply command completes.
Step 6: Manage Your Infrastructure
To make changes to your infrastructure, update the Terraform files and run the `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands again.
To destroy the infrastructure when you no longer need it, run:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
This will remove all resources defined in your Terraform files for the current environment.
Example Commands for Stage and Prod Environments
To deploy the stage environment, repeat steps 2 to 6 in the `envs/stage` directory.
```bash
cd ../stage
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
To deploy the prod environment, repeat steps 2 to 6 in the `envs/prod` directory.
```bash
cd ../prod
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
Summary
1. Unzip the project and navigate to the desired environment directory.
2. Initialize Terraform using `terraform init`.
3. Review the plan using `terraform plan`.
4. Apply the configuration using `terraform apply`.
5. Verify the deployment.
6. Manage infrastructure updates or destroy it when no longer needed.
This approach ensures that each environment (Dev, Stage, Prod) is isolated and managed independently, adhering to best practices for infrastructure as code.
